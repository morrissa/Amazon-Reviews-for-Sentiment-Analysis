# Amazon-Reviews-for-Sentiment-Analysis
Initial model for performing sentiment analysis on 1.8 million Amazon reviews, using a RNN LSTM model with a 79% accuracy. Need to revist this model as to update the model to take advantage of a database load to put less stress on RAM, as well as clean up more of the trainable features as to stop the model from running out of memory with increased batch size.

However model performs well, and as shown can be used for predicting sentiment on new text feeds.

The data used was obtained from Kaggle.com, the dataset containes 3.6 million reviews.
